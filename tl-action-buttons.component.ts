1. Structure & Coherence
•  Is the content logically organized and easy to follow?
•  Does the flow align with the stated objectives?
•  Has readability been improved through proper structuring?
2. Tone of Voice Compliance
•  Does the content apply three tone principles of PwC: Collaborative, Bold, and Optimistic?
•  Is the language conversational, clear, and jargon-free?
•  Has passive voice, unnecessary qualifiers, and jargon been avoided?

4. ARTICLE-LEVEL ENFORCEMENT — MANDATORY (Add-on)
Validate whether the Agent-edited document demonstrates the following Development Editor article-level enforcement behaviors:
Central Argument Enforcement
•  Has the Development Editor articulated the article’s central argument in one sentence before editing (or as an explicit guiding sentence in the revised article)?
•  Does the article maintain a single governing argument throughout?
Section-to-Argument Alignment
•  Does every section clearly advance, substantiate, or logically support the central argument?
•  Are any sections off-argument or adjacent? If yes, were they reframed or reduced?
Repetition & Consolidation Discipline
•  Once a core idea has been introduced and explained, is it avoided in later sections unless:
o  it adds new implications, new evidence, or new consequences?
•  If a core idea appears in more than two sections, did the editor:
o  consolidate, elevate, remove, or reframe repeated material?
•  Is repetition used only when it serves a distinct narrative function (framing vs substantiation vs synthesis)?
Length Discipline Through Pruning
•  Did the editor reduce total article length where redundancy or over-explanation exists (even if the content is “good”)?
•  Is redundancy removed via:
o  consolidation,
o  pruning repeated phrasing,
o  cutting off-topic tangents?
Point of View Control
•  Did the editor explicitly select and maintain one primary POV (e.g., market analyst, advisor, collaborator)?
•  Are there POV shifts (e.g., advisor → narrator → executive observer)? If yes, were they corrected?
One-Sentence Defensibility Test
•  If the article were summarized in one sentence, could every section be defended as serving that sentence?
•  If not, were non-serving sections revised or cut?
