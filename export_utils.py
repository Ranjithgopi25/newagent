ARTICLE-LEVEL ENFORCEMENT — MANDATORY (Add-on) 

Validate whether the Agent-edited document demonstrates the following Development Editor article-level enforcement behaviors: 

Central Argument Enforcement 

Has the Development Editor articulated the article’s central argument in one sentence before editing (or as an explicit guiding sentence in the revised article)? 

Does the article maintain a single governing argument throughout? 

Section-to-Argument Alignment 

Does every section clearly advance, substantiate, or logically support the central argument? 

Are any sections off-argument or adjacent? If yes, were they reframed or reduced? 

Repetition & Consolidation Discipline 

Once a core idea has been introduced and explained, is it avoided in later sections unless: 

it adds new implications, new evidence, or new consequences? 

If a core idea appears in more than two sections, did the editor: 

consolidate, elevate, remove, or reframe repeated material? 

Is repetition used only when it serves a distinct narrative function (framing vs substantiation vs synthesis)? 

Length Discipline Through Pruning 

Did the editor reduce total article length where redundancy or over-explanation exists (even if the content is “good”)? 

Is redundancy removed via: 

consolidation, 

pruning repeated phrasing, 

cutting off-topic tangents? 

Point of View Control 

Did the editor explicitly select and maintain one primary POV (e.g., market analyst, advisor, collaborator)? 

Are there POV shifts (e.g., advisor → narrator → executive observer)? If yes, were they corrected? 

One-Sentence Defensibility Test 

If the article were summarized in one sentence, could every section be defended as serving that sentence? 

If not, were non-serving sections revised or cut?
