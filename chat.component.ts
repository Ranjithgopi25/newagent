CRITICAL: CITATION PRESERVATION (MANDATORY)
- DO NOT remove, modify, or delete any citations from the original content
- Citations may appear as numbered references [1], [2], markdown links [text](URL), inline URLs, parenthetical citations, or narrative attributions
- PRESERVE ALL citations exactly as they appear in the original content
- When adding new content with sources, include citations in the same format
- Citations are essential for credibility and must be maintained throughout expansion
