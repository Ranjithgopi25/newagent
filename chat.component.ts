EXPANSION PRINCIPLES & GUIDELINES:

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:
Expand existing author material with new quantitative and qualitative support to strengthen existing objectives, arguments, and perspectives.

CORE REQUIREMENTS:

1. PRESERVE AUTHOR'S VOICE & INTENT:
- Maintain the author's original tone, style, and voice throughout
- Do NOT change the fundamental perspective or viewpoint
- Do NOT rewrite sentences for stylistic preferences
- Ensure all additions align with author's established arguments

2. STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- Do NOT fundamentally change or reorganize the original structure
- Keep ALL original paragraphs in their exact order
- Do NOT move paragraphs, sections, or content blocks
- Do NOT merge or split existing paragraphs unless adding substantial context
- Maintain the logical flow and progression of ideas as authored

3. CITATION & LINK PRESERVATION (MANDATORY):
- PRESERVE ALL existing citations in their original format
- Citations may appear as:
  * Numbered references: [1], [2], [3], etc.
  * Markdown links: [text](URL) or [text][1]
  * Inline URLs: http://example.com or https://example.com
  * Parenthetical citations: (Source, 2024)
  * Narrative attributions: "According to Source..."
- DO NOT remove, modify, or reformat existing citations
- When adding new content that references sources, include citations in the same format as existing ones
- If the original content has numbered citations [1], [2], continue the numbering sequence for new citations
- Preserve all hyperlinks and URLs exactly as they appear
- Citations are critical for credibility and must be maintained throughout expansion

4. SENTENCE & CONTENT EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Do NOT arbitrarily increase existing sentence length
- Only extend sentences if adding new sources, examples, evidence, or support
- Create new sentences/paragraphs to support and strengthen existing points
- Add supporting details, examples, and evidence between existing content
- Use natural spacing to integrate new material seamlessly

5. RESEARCH & DATA INTEGRATION (MANDATORY):
- Conduct research on the topic to find supporting evidence
- Incorporate at least 2–3 new sources or cite data points
- If insufficient valid sources exist, explicitly note:
  "No additional valid sources found for [specific claim]"
- Ensure all sources are credible, relevant, and properly contextualized
- Prioritize quantitative data, case studies, and industry benchmarks

6. SUPPORTING EVIDENCE STRATEGY:
- Add data points that validate and strengthen existing claims
- Include real-world examples that demonstrate author's perspectives
- Provide statistical support or case study evidence where applicable

7. CONTENT SECTION RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Suggest missing sections ONLY in a separate “Recommendations” section
- Do NOT add contradictory viewpoints

8. TONE & STYLE CONSISTENCY:
- Match sentence structure patterns from the original text
- Maintain formality and paragraph density

### TRUE EXPANSION REQUIREMENT (MANDATORY)
ALL EXPANSION MUST BE **TRUE EXPANSION — WEAVE, NOT APPEND**.
- DO NOT expand by adding sentences only at the end of paragraphs.
- ALL new material MUST be INTEGRATED INTO EXISTING PARAGRAPHS by:
  - introducing clarifying context or mechanisms early in the paragraph,
  - embedding concrete examples, data, or evidence mid-paragraph,
  - rewriting or restructuring existing sentences where needed to smoothly incorporate new insight.
- You MAY rewrite sentences to integrate evidence or explanation, PROVIDED the original meaning and intent are preserved.
- End-of-paragraph additions are permitted ONLY for brief implications or transitions.
TRUE EXPANSION REQUIRES **INTEGRATION, NOT ACCUMULATION**.

---

### EXPANSION QUALITY BAR
EVERY added sentence MUST introduce AT LEAST ONE of the following:
- a causal mechanism (“how” or “why”),
- a concrete example or real-world application,
- empirical or quantitative support,
- a practical implication for executives or stakeholders.
DO NOT add filler, emphasis-only restatements, or surface-level paraphrasing.

---

### STATISTICAL ENRICHMENT (MANDATORY)
- INCLUDE **1–2 concrete quantitative data points per major section**, where credible data exists.
- ALL statistics MUST:
  - follow the required source hierarchy,
  - be cited inline using numbered references,
  - include qualifiers if estimates vary.
- IF strong quantitative evidence does not exist, EXPLICITLY STATE this (e.g., “published estimates vary” or “quantitative evidence is limited”).

---

### COMPETITOR PROHIBITION (ABSOLUTE)
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES may you use, cite, reference, or mention content, frameworks, research, case studies, tools, or examples from:
McKinsey & Company, Boston Consulting Group, Bain & Company, Deloitte (including Monitor Deloitte), EY (including EY-Parthenon), KPMG, AT Kearney, Oliver Wyman, Roland Berger, L.E.K. Consulting, Accenture, Alvarez & Marsal.
