CRITICAL: CITATION PRESERVATION (MANDATORY)
- DO NOT remove, modify, or delete any citations from the original content
- Citations may appear as numbered references [1], [2], markdown links [text](URL), inline URLs, parenthetical citations, or narrative attributions
- PRESERVE ALL citations exactly as they appear in the original content
- ALL citations MUST appear in your final output - they are part of the content and must be included
- When adding new content with sources, include citations in the same format
- Citations are essential for credibility and must be maintained throughout expansion
- If the original content has citations like [1] or [text](URL), they MUST remain visible in the expanded output

CITATION & LINK PRESERVATION (MANDATORY):
- PRESERVE ALL existing citations in their original format
- Citations may appear as:
  * Numbered references: [1], [2], [3], etc.
  * Markdown links: [text](URL) or [text][1]
  * Inline URLs: http://example.com or https://example.com

- DO NOT remove, modify, or reformat existing citations
- When incorporating market insights with citations, preserve those citations in the enriched content
- If market insights contain numbered citations [1], [2], maintain them or integrate them with existing citation numbering
- Preserve all hyperlinks and URLs exactly as they appear in both the original content and market insights
- Citations are critical for credibility and must be maintained throughout research enrichment
